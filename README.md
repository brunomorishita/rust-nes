# rust-nes
A simple project to learn rust in a fun way for myself.

I'm going to follow this simple tutorial here:
https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/

My objective here, besides learning rust is to get a runnable simulator that can be run in any embedded linux devices with few effort.
So I'll try to use here:
 - KMS + DRM to be used in the graphics part
 - Something simple to be used in the audio part
