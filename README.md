# rust-nes
A simple project to learn rust in a fun way for myself.
How? Following a tutorial to build a NES simulator and from there trying to show the frames using libdrm.
Just like that.

I'm going to follow this simple tutorial here:
https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/

My objective here besides learning rust is to get a runnable simulator that can be used in any embedded linux devices without much effort.

To achieve that I plan to use:
 - KMS + DRM in the graphics part

## TODO
 - Find some simple and portable way to do the audio part
