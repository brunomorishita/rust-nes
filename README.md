# rust-nes
A simple project to learn rust in a fun way for myself.

I'm going to follow this simple tutorial here:
https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/

My objective here, besides learning rust is to get a runnable simulator that can be run in any embedded linux devices with few effort.

To achieve that I plan to use:
 - KMS + DRM in the graphics part
 - Something similar in the audio part
